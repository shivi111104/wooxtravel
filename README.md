Using HTML, CSS, (alongside Bootstrap, jQuery), PHP, POD and MySQL, a Tour Management System can provide a comprehensive platform for travel agencies or companies to manage their operations efciently.

With HTML and CSS, the system's user interface can be developed to offer an intuitive and visually appealing experience. PHP would handle the server-side scripting, enabling dynamic functionality and database interactions using MySQL for data storage and retrieval.

In summary, a Tour Management System using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL would provide a robust and user-friendly platform for efficient travel planning, booking, and management.
